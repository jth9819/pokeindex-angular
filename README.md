# Instructions on running the program

- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm start`.
- Open `http://localhost:4200/` in the browser.

# About the Project

The name of our application is _PokeIndex_. The idea of this application is to allow users to search for Pokemon and view general information about them. Secondly, as a new feature we have added the ability to browse Pokemon by pages in a list view. Our _home page_ has one main card that directs the user to the _search page_ & _browse page_. An _about page_ is included as well in case the user wants more info about _PokeIndex_.

# Contributions

**Implemented aspects from our stage 2 submissions**:

- We have implemented the core subject/idea & design of the application from jth46 (Justin Harrison)'s stage-2. The home page, about page, and _some_ aspects of the search page have all been kept the same, including the minimal design/UI.

- After close consideration, we decided to scrap klc16 (Keith Lahmann)'s subject/idea. In order to integrate our projects together, we decided to take Keith's browse feature (browses a list of rockets) that pulls information from an API and displays it in a list view. This, along with the search page from Justin's stage-2, worked together nicely.

- In general, we (Justin & Keith) worked together for the majority of the sprint in order to understand all of the code and how it functions in the program. We stayed in close communication and updated each other on new ideas/implementations/pushes in order to stay organized and release a well made application.
