# About the Project

This application was developed for a project in my clientside programming course. The majority of the project design and architecture was built with prior knowledge from past assignments in the course. This application was developed mainly on my own, but towards the end of the semester the instructor reccomended we team up with one other classmate to add the final features/touches.

The name of our application is _Pok√©index_. The idea of this application is to allow users to search for Pokemon and view general information about them. Secondly, as a new feature we have added the ability to browse Pokemon by pages in a list view. Our _home page_ has one main card that directs the user to the _search page_ & _browse page_. An _about page_ is included as well in case the user wants more info about _PokeIndex_.

# Contributions

In general, we worked together for the majority of the sprint in order to understand all of the code and how it functions in the program. We stayed in close communication and updated each other on new ideas/implementations/pushes in order to stay organized and release a well made application.
